# NixOS Multiple Systems Configuration Flake

- I don't know what I'm doing
- This setup has been stable for me, running this for over a year
- I do most of my work within a VM, e.g. Debian, Kali
- My system configuration philosophy is to keep it simple, defaults where possible
- Copy and paste at your own peril
